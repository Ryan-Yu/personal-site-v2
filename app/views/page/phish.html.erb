	<b>Phish</b>, as a <span class="phish-highlight">band</span> and as a <span class="phish-highlight">culture</span>, is indisputably the most <span class="phish-highlight">stimulating</span>, <span class="phish-highlight">invigorating</span>, <span class="phish-highlight">exciting</span>, and <span class="phish-highlight">interesting</span> phenomenon in the contemporary musical world. Four adjectives isn’t enough to properly convey what I’m trying to convey; if you’re reading this, you should probably go to <span class="phish-highlight">www.thesaurus.com</span> and look up a few more adjectives.<br /><br />

	I know you don’t believe me; I accept that. However, at least give me the opportunity to (maybe) change your mind, to (maybe) let you see what I see. <br /><br />

	<h2>The music: a 1000-foot introduction</h2>

	Phish is composed of four artists: Trey Anastasio (guitar), Mike Gordon (bass), Page McConnell (keyboards), and Jon Fishman (drums). Phish is also a <span class="phish-highlight">jam-band</span>. By default, artists in the jam-band genre place an overwhelming emphasis on their <span class="phish-highlight">live performances</span>, rather than their studio albums. This is because jam-bands jam in the live setting; that is, they <span class="phish-highlight">improvise</span>.<br /><br />

	Okay, you’re probably not seeing what the big deal is. I understand that. So let me try to explain a bit more.<br /><br />

	If you asked me to sum up a Phish show in two words, I would probably pause and think for a while. Then I would probably give you an answer: <br /><br />

	<i>spontaneous</i><br />
	<i>unpredictable</i><br /><br />

	If you’re not familiar with jam-bands, then I can say with some confidence that you (maybe) aren’t too familiar with these terms in the scope of live music. So let me give you an illustration:<br /><br />

	Let’s take your favorite band. Imagine that band in your head right now. What do you think they play in a live setting? If you absolutely don’t know the answer, you should go check out <span class="phish-highlight">www.setlist.fm</span>. Look at the band’s setlists from their last tour, and look at how varied they are. Probably not very; a wide majority of artists play essentially the same setlist each night on a tour, with maybe a few songs rotated in and out, or maybe a nightly change in the ordering of songs played. Furthermore, the songs are played more or less the same as they are on the artist’s corresponding studio album, save for a few small variations in some songs, perhaps. I’m not necessarily saying that this is bad; in fact, not at all. I’ve been to hundreds of these types of shows, and enjoyed myself at every single one.<br /><br />

	It’s just that Phish shows are so much more interesting.<br /><br />

	In a typical 25-35 show tour, Phish will play somewhere between <span class="phish-highlight">150 and 200 unique songs</span>. In a typical 25-35 show tour, Phish will repeat a song maybe every three shows, and that’s being extremely conservative; a large number of songs are played just once or twice on tour.<br /><br />

	You probably still don’t get it. Bear with me.<br /><br />

	Every Phish show, minus a few momentous exceptions throughout the year (which I’ll get to later), has the same characteristics. There is never an opening band; Phish always will play two sets and an encore, each set lasting approximately an hour to an hour and a half long.<br /><br />

	In a typical 3-hour Phish show, Phish will improvise around their songs, many (but not nearly all) of which are on their 12 studio albums. Different types of improvisations (which I’ll refer to from now on as “jams”), have their own unique and complex categorizations, but I’ll get to that later.<br /><br />

	<div class="phish-pictures">

	</div>

	Jams, quite simply, are what drive Phish fans to shows. While a song on studio may be the typical four or five minutes long, a version of the same song in a live setting may be <span class="phish-highlight">10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, or 30 minutes long</span>. This is not atypical at all. 

	To get a small glimpse of what I'm talking about, check out the studio version of "Tweezer" below, clocking in at 8 minutes and 41 seconds:<br /><br />

	<br />

	Now, check out this version of Tweezer from Phish's 2013 Fall Tour, which clocked in at just under 18 minutes:<br /><br />

	</div>

	<br />

	(Tweezer, in fact, is what's known as a "jam vehicle", a song particularly known to fuel long and cohesive jams -- more on this later.)<br /><br />

	To capture these moments of improvisation, Phish professionally records each show in its entirety, and makes them available for download approximately one hour after each show ends; this download is free for those in attendance. <br /><br />

	All of the above descriptions constitute what I’ve referred to as spontaneity and unpredictability. Everything about a Phish show is <span class="phish-highlight">unpredictable</span>. The band does not write setlists for shows. The band does, however, have a master list of more than two hundred songs that they know and are able to play at any given time. Every song placement within the scope of a show is a call made on the spot, a complete audible. This is what drives fans to shows. Every performance is completely unique, featuring different songs, as well as different extended improvisations contained within each of these different songs.<br /><br />
